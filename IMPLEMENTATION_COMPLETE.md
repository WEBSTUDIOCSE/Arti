## 🔧 **How to Switch Environments**

Edit `src/config/env.ts`:

```typescript
// For UAT Environment
export const IS_UAT_ENVIRONMENT = true;

// For PROD Environment  
export const IS_UAT_ENVIRONMENT = false;
```

The environment will be logged to browser console automatically.

## 📱 **PWA Testing**

1. **Open** http://localhost:3000 in Chrome/Edge
2. **Check Console** - You'll see environment logging
3. **Install App** - Look for "Install" button in address bar
4. **Test Offline** - Disconnect internet, app still works

## 🗂️ **Key Files**

- `src/config/env.ts` - Environment configuration
- `public/manifest.json` - PWA manifest
- `public/sw.js` - Service worker (auto-generated)
- `public/icons/` - PWA icons
- `src/app/offline/page.tsx` - Offline page

## ✨ **What's Working**

1. ✅ **Environment logging** to console (no page display)

3. ✅ **Installable app** on mobile/desktop
4. ✅ **Offline support** 
5. ✅ **Firebase integration** with environment switching
6. ✅ **Clean UI** - original Next.js page without environment display

The app is ready to use! 🎉
